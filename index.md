<p>Hello! I am an educator interested in collaborative work of librarians as research partners, connecting students, educators, and other stakeholders within and beyond university campuses. This website showcases a few digital projects that I have worked on recently as well as other information about work I have done in libraries and other academic contexts.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>

A PhD candidate at Princeton University specializing in Early Modern France, I have worked on a variety of library-based projects and digital initiatives at Princeton University Library and Penn Libraries at the University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about promoting digital literacies and employing digital tools to make cultural heritage materials accessible.</p>
