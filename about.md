title: "About this site" 
---

This simple site was created using the open-source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)---an intutive, user-friendly tool which is great for beginners and student projects---and is hosted on Github pages. There are a number of existing community-built [themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/), for this site I used the [Contrast theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/contrast). I made a few small modifications, many of which are covered in the HTML and CSS courses from the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
