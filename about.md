title: "About this site"

This simple site was created using the open-source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on Github pages. This intutive tool is great for beginners and student projects. There are a number of existing community-built [themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/), for this site I used the [Contrast theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/contrast) with small modifications which are based on tutorials from the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
