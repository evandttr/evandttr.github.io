As a Univeristy Administrative Fellow at Princeton University Library (PUL), I collaborated with librarians and faculty to help curate a collection of historical materials related to [Indigenous Studies](https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures) and items related to the [Lunaapeewak (Lenape or Delaware people)](https://dpul.princeton.edu/lenape) on whose ancestral lands sits the campus of Princeton University. These exhibits were curated in Princetonâ€™s Digital Library (DPUL) curatorial interface, an tool based on "Spotlight" a plugin of the Blacklight discovery interface. Both exhibits were created in preparation for the 2022 [Munsee Language and History Symposium](https://indigenous.princeton.edu/events/munsee-language-history-symposium) at Princeton.

During my time at PUL, I also helped create an [Advanced Searching Techniques](https://libguides.princeton.edu/advancedsearch) Libguide; this guide outlines general searching techniques such as boolean operators, as well as specific tips searching the PUL catalogue, and selected databases. These topics are covered basic information literacy sessions and the guide thus serves as a helpful resource.
