## Digital storytelling and exhibits 

I have built public-facing digital exhibits for a variety of collaborative library-based research projects. Here are some mock-up maps and timelines I built using Knightlab's [Storymaps JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) and [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) for a NEH-funded inter-institutional digital humanities project affiliated with Princeton University's Spanish and Portuguese department.
