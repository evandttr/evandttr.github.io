title: "Digital Storytelling" 
---
At Princeton Univeristy Library, I have built public-facing digital exhibits for a variety of collaborative library-based research projects. The frames below demonstrate some prototype maps and timelines built using open-source tools developed by Knightlab at Northwestern University, [Storymaps JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) and [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/), for a NEH-funded inter-institutional digital humanities project affiliated with Princeton University's Spanish and Portuguese department.
