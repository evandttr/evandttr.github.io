## Digital storytelling and exhibits 

I have built public-facing digital exhibits for a variety of collaborative library-based research projects. Here are some mock-up maps and timelines I built using Knightlab's [Storymaps JS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) and [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) for a NEH-funded inter-institutional digital humanities project affiliated with Princeton University's Spanish and Portuguese department.

I collaborated with librarians and faculty to help curate a collection of historical materials related to [Indigenous Studies](https://dpul.princeton.edu/indigenous-cultures) and of items related to the [Lunaapeewak (Lenape or Delaware people)](https://dpul.princeton.edu/lenape) on whose ancestral lands sits the campus of Princeton University for exhibition in Princeton's Digital Collections (DPUL) curatorial application based on Spotlight a plugin of the Blacklight discovery interface.
