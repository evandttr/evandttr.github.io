title: "Handwritten Text Recognition" 
---

As a graduate fellow at Princeton's [Center for the Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/), I designed and implemented a project to make a 16th-century manuscript held in Princeton's Special Collections more accessible to researchers using AI-powered [Handwriting Text Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwriting_recognition). This technology represents powerful means of promoting access to cultural heritage, providing the means of extracting text from cultural heritage materials and making otherwise static images of manuscripts searchable. And what's more, the surprisingly intuitive tools on the market today are a great way to introduce students to manuscript studies and paleography. 

The manuscript I worked to transcribe (cataloged as [Notes de lecture, ca. 1578-1612.](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/9960613933506421)) is a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), or a compilation of reading notes, quotations, and observations collected from other books by an anonymous author. I used the platform [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) to develop and train a handwriting recognition model and to enrich and insert tags into an excerpted transcription of the manuscript. The excerpted PDF below depicts one simple output realized using this method, a highlightable scan of the manuscript from which single lines can be copied, and raw text can be extracted. The tags and encoding are visible as colored underlining marking abbreviations, comments, errors, and unclear text.
