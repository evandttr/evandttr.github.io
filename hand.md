title: "Handwritten Text Recognition" 
---

As a graduate fellow at Princeton [Center for the Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/), I designed and implemented a project to make a 16th-century manuscript held in Princeton's Special Collections more accessible to researchers using AI-powered handwriting recognition. I used the application Transkribus to develop a handwriting recognition model and employed textual encoding to enrich and insert tags into an excerpted transcription of the manuscript.
