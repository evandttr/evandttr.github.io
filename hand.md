title: "Handwritten Text Recognition" 
---

As a graduate fellow at Princeton's [Center for the Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/), I designed and implemented a project to make a 16th-century manuscript held in Princeton's Special Collections more accessible to researchers using AI-powered handwriting recognition. The text (cataloged as [Notes de lecture, ca. 1578-1612.](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/9960613933506421)) is a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book), or a compilation of reading notes, quotations, and observations collected from other books by an unknown author. I used the platform [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/) to develop and train a handwriting recognition model and to enrich and insert tags into an excerpted transcription of the manuscript. The excerpted PDF below depicts one simple output realized using this method, a highlightable scan of the manuscript from which single lines can be copied, and raw text can be extracted. The tags and encoding are visible as colored underlining marking abbreviations, comments, errors, and unclear text.
